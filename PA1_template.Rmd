    Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

# We find the position of the maximum mean
max_pos <- which(mean_data$mean == max(mean_data$mean))

# We lookup the value of interval at this position
max_interval <- mean_data[max_pos, 1]

The 5-minute interval that contains the maximum of steps, on average across all days, is 835.
Inputing the missing values

Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NA’s)

# We use the trick that a TRUE boolean value is equivalent to 1 and a FALSE to 0.
NA_count <- sum(is.na(activity$steps))

The number of NA’s is 2304.

    Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

    Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NA’s)
# Find the NA positions
na_pos <- which(is.na(activity$steps))

# Create a vector of means
mean_vec <- rep(mean(activity$steps, na.rm=TRUE), times=length(na_pos))

We use the strategy to remplace each NA value by the mean of the steps attribute.

Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

# Replace the NAs by the means
activity[na_pos, "steps"] <- mean_vec

## Loading and preprocessing the data
In case it hasn't been done already, we unzip the archive. We then read the file into the variable data.

if(!file.exists("a")) unzip("activity.zip")
data <- read.csv("activity.csv", colClasses = c("numeric", "Date", "numeric"))



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

# Compute the total number of steps each day (NA values removed)
sum_data <- aggregate(activity$steps, by=list(activity$date), FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)

# Rename the attributes
names(sum_data) <- c("date", "total")

The histogram is given by the following lines of code:

# Compute the histogram of the total number of steps each day
hist(sum_data$total, 
     breaks=seq(from=0, to=25000, by=2500),
     col="blue", 
     xlab="Total number of steps", 
     ylim=c(0, 20), 
     main="Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day\n(NA removed)")

The mean and median are computed like

mean(sum_data$total)
median(sum_data$total)
These formulas gives a mean and median of 9354 and 10395 respectively.



## What is the average daily activity pattern?

Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

# Compute the means of steps accross all days for each interval
mean_data <- aggregate(activity$steps, 
                       by=list(activity$interval), 
                       FUN=mean, 
                       na.rm=TRUE)

# Rename the attributes
names(mean_data) <- c("interval", "mean")

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
